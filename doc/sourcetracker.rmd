**All of the code in this page is meant to be run on the command line unless otherwise specified.**

##Install SourceTracker  
First, get SourceTracker from github.com  
**These commands must be run on the command line**  
```{r eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker.git

# Enter the repository folder
cd sourcetracker

# Create a system variable called SOURCETRACKER_PATH pointing to this directory
# We will add it to a .Renviron file in your home directory.
echo "" >> $HOME/.Renviron
echo "SOURCETRACKER_PATH=$PWD" >> $HOME/.Renviron


```

## Run SourceTracker on example data
This will run SourceTracker with only 2 restarts. Note: on MSI, run this first: `module load R`
```{r eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
Rscript sourcetracker_for_qiime.r -i data/otus.txt -m data/metadata-subset.txt -o outdir -v -n 2
```

This will produce pie charts, bar charts, and distribution charts (see Figure 2C in SourceTracker paper). For example, we can see a mixture of gut and oral sources on the NICU surface in `sink_predictions_pie_NICU.pdf`:

## Run SourceTracker on other data
To run SourceTracker on other data, you need to do the following things:

1. Use a text-based OTU or Taxon table. You can get a text-based OTU table by running `biom convert -i otutable.biom -o otutable.txt --to-tsv` on your biom-formatted OTU table. You can get a text-based taxonomy summary by running the QIIME command `summarize_taxa.py -i otutable.biom -o taxa` and choosing one of the output files ending with `.txt`. If you are using an older version of QIIME
2. Include an "Env" column in your mapping file. You can open the mapping file in Excel or Google Docs and create a column indicating the known or expected source environment for each sample.
3. Include a "SourceSink" column in your mapping file. This column should say "source" for source samples and "sink" for sink samples.
